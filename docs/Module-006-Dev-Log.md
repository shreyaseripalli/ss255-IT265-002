#### Goals for this Module
Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
- [ ] Goal 1: Complete Design Treatment
- [ ] Goal 2: Prepare for Midterm
- [ ] Goal 3: Prepare for Game (Physical) Prototype


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I have completed the design treatment and I have submitted the treatment onto Canvas.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - I have not faced such challenges.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - There were no challenges, hence there are no solutions.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- I explored different ways that I could approach the physical prototype for my game.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- N/A

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- I plan to have my physical prototype completed.
