#### Goals for this Module

- [ ] Goal 1: Thinking of Game Ideas
- [ ] Goal 2: Deciding whether it be a board game or card game?
- [ ] Goal 3: Finishing Design Treatment Homework


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I have decided that I would like to create a science fiction related board game.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Fortunately, I have faced no challenges this week.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - Since I have faced no challenges, there are no solutions.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- I am learning on how my make my board game adequate.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- I would like to make this game directed more towards middle schoolers, grades 6th through 8th.


- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  


#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- I would like to polish up my Design Treatment Homework.
