Change Log

There have been many changes that occurred during the process of testing and working on the physical prototype and the digital prototype. In contrast to the physical prototype, due to time constraints and lack of expertise, there were some game mechanics that were left out in the digital prototype. For instance, there are no fill in the blank questions and time limit in the digital prototype. However, the digital prototype has trickier multiple choice questions, for example, one level after another - the amount of choices to choose from becomes higher and higher which helps add difficulty to the game. In addition, in contrast with the physical prototype, the digital prototype will reveal the amount of questions the player got correct and wrong, the amount of questions the player skipped, and the total amount of questions they encountered. By doing this, the player will get a good understanding of where they stand and where they may need to improve the next time they play the game.
