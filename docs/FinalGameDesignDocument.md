Change Log

There have been many changes that occurred during the process of testing and working on the physical prototype and the digital prototype. In contrast to the physical prototype, due to time constraints and lack of expertise, there were some game mechanics that were left out in the digital prototype. For instance, there are no fill in the blank questions and time limit in the digital prototype. However, the digital prototype has trickier multiple choice questions, for example, one level after another - the amount of choices to choose from becomes higher and higher which helps add difficulty to the game. In addition, in contrast with the physical prototype, the digital prototype will reveal the amount of questions the player got correct and wrong, the amount of questions the player skipped, and the total amount of questions they encountered. By doing this, the player will get a good understanding of where they stand and where they may need to improve the next time they play the game. 

Changes and progress steps made to the digital prototype:

1. Adding the microsoft powerpoint trivia game with basic functionality.

2. Adding level saturn to the microsoft powerpoint trivia game.

3. Adding level jupiter and level mars to the microsoft powerpoint trivia game.

4. Adding the backstory slide and rules slide to the microsoft powerpoint trivia game.

5. Fixed the 'pass' button calculations during testing phase.


GAME TITLE: Floating Far From Home

GAME BACKSTORY: During the year of 3050, an astronaut named Carl is assigned to visit our solar system, more specifically - neptune, in search of extraterrestrial life. However, when Carl enters neptune, he presses and messes with some of the controls of the spaceship given to him and due to his poor behavior, the spaceship breaks down and Carl is unable to return to earth. Therefore, the name “Clumsy Carl” is given to him. And now it is the player’s job to take on the role of Clumsy Carl and return to earth.

GAME PREMISE: Floating far from home is an educational, science fiction themed, role playing game (rpg), single player board game where the player needs to accurately answer astronomy related questions in order to succeed at the game.

GAMEPLAY & RULES: Floating far from home has five levels with six astronomy related questions on each level. The level names are as follows: level neptune, level uranus, level saturn, level jupiter, and level mars. The player will begin on level neptune and end on level mars. Once level mars is complete, clumsy carl may return to earth. In addition, the player is also rewarded a certain amount of stars based on the accuracy of their answers.

GAME MECHANICS: 
Trivia Questions: There are different topics of astronomy that the questions cover - such as our solar system, planetary science, constellations, moon phases, and astrophysics. There are also different kinds of formatting of the questions for each level - such as multiple choice, true/false, and image based questions.
Adding Difficulty: As the player completes one level after another, the questions become more and more difficult and there are also more options to choose from to pick the correct answer, which also adds to the difficulty.
Movement: The player will be able to move from one planet to another, a planet closer to earth, after completing a set of questions.
Role Playing: When playing the game, the player will take on the role of Clumsy Carl.
Star Collection: There is a certain amount stars the player can collect per level based on how many answers they have gotten correct.
Highscore System: Once the game is completed, the player can decide to play the game again to try to beat their highscore, more specifically - earn a higher amount of stars.

TARGET AUDIENCE: The target audience is directed towards middle school students. The questions are at an educational level that middle school students can comprehend and answer. The game also welcomes older players who are interested in astronomy and trivia-like games.

STRATEGIES & UNIQUE SELLING POINTS: The best strategy is to study and learn about astronomy ahead of time. And a unique selling point is that there are few single player astronomy related trivia-like games that are directed primarily towards middle school students where there is a star collection system. The star collection system shows how many stars the player has earned after completing the game and the player can replay the game to earn a higher amount of stars the following time.
