- 2D and Hex Grids.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- N/A

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
